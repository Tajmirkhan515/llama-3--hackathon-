Vision AssistAI: Empowering the Visually Impaired 

 

Abstract: 

 

Vision Assist AI is an innovative project aimed at enhancing the independence and quality of life for visually impaired individuals through advanced AI technology. This tool leverages the capabilities of the LLaMA 3 model, integrated with computer vision and machine learning algorithms, to provide comprehensive assistance in navigation, text recognition, object identification, and face recognition. 

 

The global assistive technology market, valued at USD 19.8 billion in 2020 and projected to reach USD 31.3 billion by 2027, underscores the growing need and potential for such solutions. Key drivers include the increasing prevalence of visual impairments, an aging population, advancements in AI, and supportive government initiatives. 

 

Vision Assist AI addresses the significant challenges faced by visually impaired individuals, such as difficulty in navigating unfamiliar environments, reading printed text, recognizing faces and objects, and the dependence on others for daily activities. By offering features like real-time navigation guidance, text-to-speech conversion, object recognition, and face identification, Vision Assist AI empowers users to perform daily activities independently, enhances their personal safety, and improves their overall quality of life. 

 

Our solution stands out due to its advanced AI capabilities, user-centric design, and commitment to continuous improvement based on user feedback. Vision Assist AI not only promotes inclusivity by making public spaces more accessible but also ensures that visually impaired individuals can participate more fully in social and professional activities, thereby fostering a more inclusive society.
